Summary: This application webscrapes a local business's website for their Twitter feed which
contains their instock flavors for the week.  This data is then compared to a database of customers
and a collection of those customers' favorite flavors.  Each customer that has a favorite flavor instock
will then recieve a text message informing them that their favorite flavors are instock.  This solves an
issue with customers not feeling inclined to check the company's Twitter feed often.
