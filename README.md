Summary: This is a webscraper that takes data from a local business's twitter feed.  
The Twiiter feed is expected to have postings of their daily flavors.  The problem 
is that their faithful customer, me, doesn't feel like checking their twitter 
feed everyday for my favorite flavors.  This app will text my phone when any of my favorite 
flavors are available.
